# JWLib Backup Editor

## Introduction

JWLib Backup Editor is a utility to edit a .jwlibrary backup file. These backup files are created using the JW LibraryÂ® backup command, and contain your personal notes, highlighting, etc.

JWLib Backup Editor currently only supports removing notes by tag.

## Important Notes
Please use at your own risk! A corrupt backup file can possibly crash JW Library and sometimes the only solution is to reinstall JW Library and reset its data. (This hasn't quite happened yet with a backup file edited with JWLib Backup Editor)

There is no guarantee of software support. But, if you find a bug or any other problem, please feel free to create an issue in this project or contact the developer at notabela@hotmail.com

The editing process is being executed only on the client device and no backups will be transmitted to the servers of JWLib Backup Editor. Therefore your notes are safe from being accessed by anybody else.
